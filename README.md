Custom basic HTML boilerplate
=========================

To compile the CSS do the following if you're using command line:

cd to current project directory

Enter: sass --watch sass/sitewide.scss:css/sitewide.css

If you use something like Compass then just do whatever you would otherwise do.

Carry on.
